Prerequistes

* TKYProf uses some of HTML5 features, but does not support graceful downgrading. You need a modern browser supporting HTML5 and CSS3 for now.
* TKYProf is written in Haskell. Haskell Platform and Cabal are required.

1. `cabal install tkyprof` installs the executable `tkyprof`.
2. Run `tkyprof` on your terminal.
3. Access [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
4. Drag and drop your profiling reports.
